The following repository is adapted from: Temproal Dynamics of The Sap Microbiome of Grapevine Under High Pierce's Disease Pressure published in Frontiers in Plant Science 2019. Authored by ZellaD and Co Author Philippe E. Rolshausen

This study provides a comprehensive culture-independent microbiome analysis(both bacterial 16S and fungal ITS) from the sap of grapevine overtime and in a context of a vascular disease (Pierce's Disease).

The code to create many of the graphs for this paper can be found in this repository as well as the graphs themselves.
